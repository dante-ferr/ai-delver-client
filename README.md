# AI Delver

**AI Delver** is a simulation framework where an AI agent learns to navigate 2D environments filled with obstacles, traps, and goals. It combines procedural level design, reinforcement learning, and custom visualization to explore how agents adapt to dynamic dungeon-like environments.

## Features

- ðŸ§  **AI Integration**: Reinforcement learning support for training agents to solve complex spatial challenges.
- ðŸ§± **Level Editor**: (Coming soon) A GUI tool for designing levels using a tile-based system powered by Pytiling.
- ðŸ“Š **Replay System**: Save and review agent behaviors across different environments (NOT AVAILABLE YET).

## Subprojects

- [`pytiling`](./pytiling): Autotiling engine for procedural and user-defined map generation.
- [`pyglet_dragonbones`](./pyglet_dragonbones): Renderer for DragonBones animation assets in `pyglet`.
